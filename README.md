Coffee Shop SASS Example
========================

Coffee shop website to serve as a SASS example for WCSEA 2014.

This is a parody website for a fictional coffee shop. It's designed to be a pretty example for use in a SASS workshop at WordCamp Seattle 2014

## Branches
The workshop starts here, on the master branch. There are several sections. I recommend
approaching them in the following order:
1. Imports
2. Variables
3. Maps
4. Functions
5. Placeholder classes / extends
6. Mixins
7. Fonts and Control Structures

You will likely come up with different approaches than I've taken, and that's totally ok,
but if you'd like to see my result, it's on the completed-workshop branch.

## Preview
Using a nifty service called [htmlpreview.github.io](htmlpreview.github.io), we can sorta preview the
workshop before downloading. But why not download?
